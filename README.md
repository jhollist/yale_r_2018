# Introduction to Reproducible Workflows with R, Markdown, and GitHub 

**Date:** Friday March 9, 2018

**Location:** Yale University, Center for Industrial Ecology 

**Details:** In this one day workshop we will introduce the R programming language with a focus on tidy data, reproducibility, and version control with Git and Github.  Attendees should leave with some basic skills in R, be able to create a reproducible research document in markdown, and know the basics of how to use git and GitHub.  Our examples will focus on data visualization and examples from industrial ecology.

# Set Up

For this workshop, we will be using R, RStudio, and Git and all attendees should have these installed and working prior to the workshop.  The best instructions I know of for R and Git are the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop set up instructions so I will rely on those.

- Git: [Software Carpentry Git Installation Directions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#git)
- R: [Software Carpentry R Installation Directions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#r)

If you follow these directions you should have a working install of both Git and R.  They do also point you to RStudio in the R set up instructions.  If you followed along there you might have also installed RStudio.  If you did not or need some more guidance here are some additional details.

- Go to the [RStudio page for the Desktop downloads](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- Select from the "Installers for Supported Platforms" for your operating system.  The two most likely will be:
  - [Windows 7/8/10 64-bit RStudio 1.1.423](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.423.exe)
  - [Mac OS X 10.6+ 64-bit](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.423.dmg)
- Using the installer, install RStudio how you normally would install any application on your computer.
