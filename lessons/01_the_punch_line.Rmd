# The Punch Line First

For this workshop we are starting at the end and working backwards.  As such this first lesson is going to be in a follow the leader mode.  This is a useful way to teach this as we get to see what is possible early on and then we can focus on the details of how we get there and you will have a working example of a markdown document, on github, that includes a full data analysis.  Let's get started

## Fork my repository

## Create a new project in RStudio from your Github Repository

## Open up the R Markdown Document

## Generate the html from your document

## Now try a different year
