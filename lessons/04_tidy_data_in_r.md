So we now have two data frames (R speak for a dataset), but the best way to plot these is to have them in a single data frame.  The best way I know how to do this is by using the concept of [tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).  The essence of which can be summed up as:

1. Each column is a variable
2. Each row is an observation
3. Each cell has a single value
